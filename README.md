# ng-conf 2017: Mischief Maker

ng-conf 2017 presentation with Angular, midi controller, music, and mischief. The primary purpose of this talk was to be entertaining and so there is a distinct "proof of concept" element within the code base. With that said, this is a great place to start if you are looking to hook up a midi controller into an Angular application and do some interesting things.
